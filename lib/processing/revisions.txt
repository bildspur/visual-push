PROCESSING 3.0b7 (REV 0245) - 22 September 2015

It's 8:57pm and Jakub and Ben are still holed up at Fathom's studio in Boston.
Ben is wishing he was Jakub's age, as his wrists, neck, and back all feel 
like a bag of broken pretzels after several hours/days/weeks/months of coding. 
A bleary-eyed Jakub emerges from deep inside the error checker and completion

PROCESSING 3.0b6 (REV 0244) - 11 September 2015

And I beheld when he had released the sixth beta, and, lo, there was 
a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, 
and the moon became as blood.

Aside from bug fixes, the FX2D renderer has received a lot of attention. 
On the plus side, it's working really well. On the minus side, we're giving
up on making it the default for 3.0. The underlying JavaFX technology it uses
is just not ready for our use. It is, however, super fast and makes great
looking 2D sketches on retina devices. But it can be a little balky so we
don't want it to be the first experience that beginners have with Processing.
Especially if you're doing 2D on a retina Mac, you should definitely try FX2D. 
We're at the limit of what we can do performance-wise with the default 
(JAVA2D) renderer, so if you're having performance problems, try FX2D.

PROCESSING 3.0b4 (REV 0242) - 17 August 2015

Fixes for several long-standing bugs, plus some internal changes 
to make the code slightly more usable by contributors. 

For Tool and Mode developers, several functions have moved out of 
processing.app.Base and into the Messages and Platform classes.
For instance, Base.isWindows() has moved to Platform.isWindows()
(seems almost logical, right?) We're not keeping deprecated versions
of these functions around since we're breaking other things in 3.0.

Library/Mode/Tool authors, there's a section for you at the end of
this page: https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Changes-in-3.0
If there's anything that's not covered properly, please file an issue:
https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/new

Meanwhile, Jakub Valtar is holed up at Fathom in Boston, fixing all of
the bugs. See "your contributions are funding graphics fixes," below.

PROCESSING 3.0b2 (REV 0240) - 9 August 2015

Several delicious bug fixes to repair things that cropped up in the first
beta release. Please keep the reports & code coming and help us get to 3.0.


[ bug fixes ]

+ "Add Library..." fails with "Could not write to temporary directory"
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3548

+ Make size(displayWidth, displayHeight) still run in a window.
  Fixes "fullScreen() cannot be used here" message on startup.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3545
  In the past we were auto-detecting if it was the screen size, 
  and switching to full screen mode. But that's now removed because
  fullScreen() is so easy, and full screen may not be wanted.

+ Cannot find "processing.core" library. Line 12 in tab sketch_150704a"
  also happens with "import to com.jogamp.opengl.GL2"
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3547
  Code still ran properly, but looked like errors in the editor.

+ Remove "pair is" debug messages from Welcome screen

+ Save Export to Application settings between uses
  
+ Fix NullPointerException in setVertex()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3553
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3550

+ Toggling between noLights and PointLight in draw() behaving strangely
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3546
  
+ NullPointerException in Planets demo
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3551

+ Late breaking fix to repair Tweak mode
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3562
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3563

  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3420

+ Initialize the Find dialog with the current selection
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3457

+ Disable Export button when no platforms selected. In previous releases,
  it would report "done exporting!" but nothing had actually happened.

+ Prevent Export with examples and untitled/unsaved sketches
  
+ Links in error bar are not selectable nor clickable
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3471


[ internal/development fixes ]

+ Building: make the download-jdk-macosx target work properly

+ Throw an error when using methods that require sketchPath outside setup()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3433

+ Cleaned up the advanced OpenGL wiki page
  
+ cursor(CROSS) breaks when using surface.setTitle()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3472


[ fixed earlier ]

+ blend() and copy() are not pixel accurate for copy/scale
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/324
  Fixed somewhere between 0179 and 0184

PROCESSING 3.0b1 (REV 0239) - 6 August 2015

This is the big one! The first beta, which will now be the default download
on the site. That means we think this is the best release of Processing that's
currently available, and that nearly everyone should be using it. It doesn't
mean we've worked out all the bugs just yet, but hey, who has?

A still-in-progress rundown of the changes in Processing 3 is here:
https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Changes-in-3.0

2.x Modes, Tools, and Libraries will need to be updated for 3.x, so if you're
an author of these, see the notes in the link above. We're also planning some
sort of online Q & A / office hours / talk to Ben about what's changed session
to help folks along. We want to help, we just need to find the time.

And for those into the nitty gritty, or who enjoy lame jokes about esoteric 
technical details, the detailed changes since 3.0 alpha 11 are below.

PROCESSING 3.0a11 (REV 0238) - 16 July 2015

Hopefully the last release before we go to beta. 


[ new additions ]

+ You'll be greeted by a Welcome screen. We haven't finished the text for
  one of these yet, so you'll see some lorem ipsum (fake) text instead.
  We'll wrap that up before the beta release.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3358


[ breaking all of the things ]

+ For Tool and Mode authors, you'll need to make some (small) changes.
  These aren't structural, but will require a rebuild of your code.
  Our hope is that this will be the last round of changes for the 3.x
  series, and that it's now safe to update your Modes and Tools to be
  compatible with the final 3.x release. Changes in this release:
  
  - Several classes have been moved to a new processing.app.ui package.
    The processing.app package was much too unwieldy and made it difficult
    for people to hack on the PDE code.
    
  - Several functions have moved out of Base and into Util (or Toolkit).
    Most of these are file-related (removeDir() and others), but the
    Base class had simply grown to a ridiculous size. It remains enormous
    but is a little less ridiculous.

+ Removed the init() method from PApplet; it's no longer needed


[ fixing all of the things ]

+ Show warning when display spanning is turned off with fullScreen(SPAN)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3381

+ sketch.isReadOnly returns false for examples coming from multiple modes
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/773

PROCESSING 3.0a10 (REV 0237) - 9 June 2015

Huge release! Knocking on the door for beta, this includes many changes
and improvements for how displays of all kinds (single, multiple, retina, 
high dpi) are handled, plus smoothing, full screen, etc etc. 


[ breaking things for the future ] 

+ Added fullScreen() method to make it far easier to run sketches 
  using the full screen. Reference notes and explanation here:
  https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues/250
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3296

+ smooth() and noSmooth() can only be used once per sketch, in setup().
  See the changes, the explanation, and the discussion here:
  https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues/251
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3357

+ Re-opened the Gates of Hell by adding chaining operations to PVector
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/257
  
+ Changed exec() and open() to use varargs. Changed open() to launch()
  to prevent problems with Python Mode.

+ Replaced --full-screen command line option with --present to untangle
  full screen versus the "Present" command that places blanks the rest
  of the screen around a sketch.
  
+ ortho() function is being reworked to make it compliant
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1278


[ other changes and additions ]

+ Added new application and export icons. Mmm!

+ Add retina/high-res display support to OpenGL
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2573

+ Add pixelDensity(2) command to enable retina or high-dpi mode for
  your sketch. Make things look beautiful and crisp on expensive hardware!
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3361

+ Added displayDensity() methods to get the pixel density for individual
  displays. displayDensity() returns the density (1 or 2) of the default
  (or currently selected) display, displayDensity(1) returns the density
  of display 1. Guess how you get the density of display 2?

+ Add useful constructors to the Int/Float/StringList classes


[ bug fixes ]

+ Fix monitor numbering problems
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3309

+ Full screen doesn't work on second window w/o present mode
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3271
  
+ Full screen on OS X 10.9 has incorrect placement
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3305

+ "Run sketches on display" not working properly
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3264

+ Comments influencing code (preproc issues in parsing)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3326
  
+ Sketch not appearing depending on arangement of external display on OS X
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3118
  
+ Sketch launching on second display that's not currently in use
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3082
  
+ strokeWeight() in setup() not working for default renderer
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3331

+ Retain original java.awt.Frame when it's available from PSurfaceAWT

+ Set frame icon images for Java2D (dock and cmd-tab) 
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/257

+ Debug message showing up in 3.0a9 when dragging and dropping files

+ Rolled back to 3.0a5 version of appbundler due to crash on startup
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3359
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3360
  This re-introduces a few bugs related to the serial library and 
  scrolling and any other changes later than 16 November 2015
  https://github.com/processing/processing/commits/master/build/macosx/appbundler.jar

PROCESSING 3.0a8 (REV 0235) - 17 May 2015

Stabilizing the mess from 3.0a6 and 3.0a7. Read the release notes for
those versions (below) if you haven't already.

If you're using Eclipse or another IDE, be sure to read the "changes"
section below, for a change in how the size() command works.


[ fixes ]

+ size() sometimes erratic (i.e default size used) This was often 
  seen with large setup() functions, or on more esoteric platforms.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1672

+ Command line "processing-java" was broken
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3224

+ Sketchbook window requires restart of Processing before updating
  after sketchbook location change.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3214
  
+ Replace & Find was reading "Find & Replace" 
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3247

+ "One file added to sketch" message when two files added

+ pop() was not implemented correctly in String/Int/FloatList

+ Errors in file name case differences not correctly reported
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3235

+ Single Frame (no screen display) PDF broken
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3280

+ "Buffers have not been created" error for sketches w/o draw()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2469


[ changes ]

+ Behind the scenes, the size() method is now moved out of setup()
  and into a method named settings(). The settings() is called before
  setup() and is the only place where size() can be used. If using
  Processing without the PDE (i.e. with another IDE like Eclipse),
  remove the size() method from setup() and instead place it like so:
  
  public void settings() {
    size(400, 400, P3D);  // your size() command here
  }
  
  The rest of your code remains unchanged. The PDE does this 
  transparently, so 99% of people won't even notice this change.
  However, it allows us to fix (and avoid) a lot of really nasty
  complications that come from how Processing lets you switch
  between 2D drawing and OpenGL and even something like PDF with
  simple changes to the size() method.

  We're trying "settings()" as the method name, but that may change
  in a future alpha release. Once we hit beta, it will not change.

  For those familiar with them, the sketchWidth(), sketchHeight(),
  sketchRenderer(), etc methods should no longer be used. This new
  implementation of the settings() method is a simpler solution.

+ Added SVG Export library (works like PDF Export). This has not
  been tested heavily yet. 

+ Replace Tweak Mode ColorSelector with JComponent version
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3209

+ Fairly major rewrite of createShape(), shouldn't affect anything,
  but keep an eye out for regressions.

+ Add new String/Int/FloatDict constructors that take an array for
  useful static/<init> initialization

+ Move svgz handling to PApplet, remove objz handling

+ Implement blendMode in FX2D
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3275

+ Added StringList(Object...) constructor to handle a grab bag of objects

+ Added appendUnique() to Int/Float/StringList to only add unique items
  to a list. Replaces the following code, making "set" operations easier:
  if (!theList.hasValue(value)) {
    thiList.append(value);
  }

+ Inside main(), don't set 'args' to a zero-length array if no args 
  were passed in, instead leave 'args' null. 


[ debugger ]

+ Debugger "String is null" error when hitting breakpoint
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3265

+ Change "method" to "function" in a few error messages
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3225
  
+ Error message for incorrect function arguments is wonky
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3268
  
+ String concatenation mistakes produce odd error messages
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3253

  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3208
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3227
  
+ Keep the tab menu at the right-hand side

[ opengl by andres ]

PROCESSING 3.0a6 (REV 0233) - 25 April 2015

This is the big one! We've jettisoned PApplet as the base class so that
we can improve performance, reduce flicker, and have a better base from
which to build better, more modern graphics rendering. More of the 
gory details for the PApplet/PGraphics changes can be found here:
https://github.com/processing/processing/tree/master/core

Speaking of breaking things, we're on the road to a new GUI as well:
https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3072
and that means all Modes and some Tools will need to be updated:
https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3080

We've also made major changes to better integrate PDE X, Tweak Mode, 
and other nice features for the default "Java" Mode. These will be the
center of the changes for 3.x, which is focused on improving the editing 
and debugging experience in general. 

Suffice to say, this is truly an ALPHA quality release. We're pushing it
out so that we can get more people testing it. If you want something more
stable, we recommend 3.0a5 (not 2.2.1, that thing is old!) 

Library/Mode/Tool authors: Please help us get 3.0 ready by getting your
code ready for 3.0! Because 2.x and 3.x contributions are separate, you
can maintain separate versions if you like (or only support 3.x). You 
can also specify the earliest and latest revisions of Processing that 
your code supports, so that it's only installed with the correct version. 
If anything is unclear, please file an issue. I've not had time to write
up all the changes yet (and some are still in progress), but what you see
in this release is representative of where we're headed for 3.0.

[ sketch ]

+ Added E2D, an experimental/enhanced renderer that draws directly 
  to the Graphics context without an intermediate image. This greatly 
  speeds up performance (especially on retina/hidpi displays), but 
  prevents pixel access (no save(), saveFrame(), loadPixels(), etc). 
  It also causes some rendering hiccups (frame rate is not as smooth), 
  but that's why it's experimental.

  (these were unintentionally auto-imported from PGraphics)

PROCESSING 3.0a4 (REV 0231) - 12 September 2014

Another release to deal with a handful of bugs found in the last alpha.
The next alpha release will contain major changes and break a few libraries
and tools, so this is an attempt at a final "stable" alpha that can be used
until all those issues are sorted out.

[ changes ] 

+ Contributions (Libraries, Modes, Tools) are now read from their own
  listing that's specific to Processing 3.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2850
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2849

+ Made the new editor the default. 

+ The OS X default File menu (shown when no windows are open) now has the
  order/naming changes found in the sketch window File menu. 

+ Turning off file watching because of errant "this sketch has changed"
  messages. Hopefully this will return soon.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2852

+ Turned off code completion by default and reset its preference name.


[ bug fixes ] 

+ TGAs from saveFrame() create transparent/black movies with Movie Maker
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2851

+ Fix export problem on Windows when using the new editor
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2806

+ Fix black outline around scaled fonts with the OpenGL renderer
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2845
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2856

+ Several fixes to the contributions manager:
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2798
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2831


[ internal tweaks ] 

+ Optimize creation of boxed primitives
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2826

+ Add static modifier to inner classes that don't access parent
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2839

PROCESSING 3.0a3 (REV 0230) - 26 August 2014

The 3.0 process continues as we've wrapped up a very successful 
Google Summer of Code, and have also been integrating contributions
(internationalization!) from some helpful community members. 

In particular, Jakub Valtar, Darius M, and Frederico Bond are my heroes:
https://github.com/processing/processing/commits/master?author=jakubvaltar
https://github.com/processing/processing/commits/master?author=federicobond
https://github.com/processing/processing/commits/master?author=voidplus


[ changes ]

+ Removed toolbar buttons except for start/stop. This is part of a larger
  set of GUI changes for 3.0. At the moment it makes the design really
  awkward, but we needed to take the step in preparation for the larger
  changes to come.

  32-bit versions are still in the works.

+ Don't write sketch.properties unless it's a non-default mode
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2531

+ Add another NaN check when sorting FloatList/Dict classes.
  If all values were NaN, an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException was thrown.

+ PShape for JAVA2D (in progress)

PROCESSING 3.0a2 (REV 0229) - 31 July 2014

The 3.0 train gains steam and continues to hurtle down the track.


[ changes ] 

+ Added a new sketchbook location, so that you can have separate sketchbooks
  with 2.0 and 3.0 releases. The downside is that they won't stay in sync, 
  but the upside is that sketches that haven't been updated, or conflicting
  Libraries, Modes, or Tools won't cause trouble with the other version. 
  The new preference is called sketchbook.location.three (the old preference
  was sketchbook.location). If you already have a 2.0 sketchbook, that will
  be used by default with 3.0 until you change it in the Preferences window.

+ Neglected to mention with the previous release that the video library has
  been removed from the default download. This decreases the size of the
  Processing download by about 20%. In addition, it was only the video 
  library for the platform being downloaded, and with the return of cross-
  platform application export, that could cause sadness. To use the video
  library, use the "Add Library..." menu and select it from the list.

+ Added a new preference for the 3.0 sketchbook location, so that a separate
  sketchbook (and with it, different Modes, Tools, and Libraries) can be 
  used with Processing 3.0 versus older versions of 2.x.

+ Remove default menu bar hack for OS X
  http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8022667

+ Move to native OS X full screen (supported in 10.7 and later)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2641
  This allows us to remove native code for hiding the menu bar. 
  But it may introduce more quirks, we'll have to test it out.


[ fixes ] 

+ The Examples weren't included in 3.0a1. Oops.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2652

+ Fix "No such file or directory" error when exporting on Mac OS X.
  This bug actually meant that OS X apps weren't signed
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2614

+ Prevent opening sketches multiple times
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2506

+ Disable Mac OS X export button on other platforms
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2642

+ Removed duplicate 'fonts' folder in the download

+ Removed welcome message from the sound library

+ Get the 'modified' indicator working on OS X document windows again
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2194

+ Do bounds check on setVertex(PVector)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2556

+ Using createGraphics() w/o begin/endDraw(), don't attempt drawing w/ image()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2208


[ the data classes ] 

+ Add copy() method to Table

+ Return null from getString() with float and double values that are NaN.
  Fixes how saveTable() works (writes blank entries instead of NaN).

+ get(5) with an empty Int/Float/StringList was returning 0
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2343

+ FloatDict and FloatList should always put NaN values at the end on sort.

+ Add print() method to the various data types.


[ summer of code ]

+ URL opening problem fixed by use of getCanonicalPath() on Windows
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2656

+ If Server constructor fails, throw an exception
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2604

+ Clear status messages in the Contribution Manager

  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/70
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2370

+ NullPointerException in addBreakpointComments() when saving sketch

PROCESSING 3.0a1 (REV 0228) - 26 July 2014

Kicking off the 3.0 release process. The focus for Processing 3 is improving
the editor and the coding process, so we'll be integrating what was formerly
PDE X as the main editor.

This release also includes a number of bug fixes and changes, based on 
in-progress Google Summer of Code projects and a few helpful souls on Github.

Please contribute to the Processing 3 release by testing and reporting bugs.
Or better yet, helping us fix them and submitting pull requests.

  A major problem on OS X, thanks to David Fokkema for tracking down a fix.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2402
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2455

+ Re-open current sketch in new mode editor if file extension is compatible.
  This was a regression in 2.1.2 due to the Python Mode changes.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2457
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2456

+ Crash in the 'recent' menu on startup

[ export to application ]

+ The return of multi-platform export! Create applications for Windows
  and Linux while using OS X. Create a Linux application from Windows. 
  Against my better judgement, we're supporting it again. It's extremely
  difficult, but was disappointing to remove it earlier.

+ When exporting with local Java embedded, always use that version
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2349

+ Change Windows export to use launch4j instead of our custom launcher.
  This will fix many, many problems, but may introduce some new ones. 

+ Windows (64-bit) now creates a proper .exe instead of a .bat file
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/923

+ Exported apps reporting as "damaged" on OS X
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2095
  You'll have to install Xcode to remove the warnings, but it's possible

PROCESSING 2.1 (REV 0223) - 27 October 2013

There have been major changes since 2.0.3, most of them are outlined in 
the release notes for 2.1 beta 1 (look down a few dozen lines).

This release includes a few updates to fix problems introduced in the beta 
release, as well as additional general bug fixes, especially for OpenGL.

+ Added an option to not embed the Java runtime into an exported application.
  This saves you the 100 MB footprint, but requires your users to install
  Java 7u45 or later. Details on the same page that nobody read last time:
  http://wiki.processing.org/w/Export_Info_and_Tips

+ The new println() (see the beta 1 notes) makes some old code behave a 
  little differently. In the past, println() with an array would write 
  out the array, one element per line, with the index in the front. i.e.:
  PFont.list()) would write something like this to the console:

  [0] "Serif"
  [1] "SansSerif"
  [2] "Monospaced"
  [3] "Dialog"
  [4] "DialogInput"
  [5] "ACaslonPro-Bold"
  [6] "ACaslonPro-BoldItalic"
  ...and so on

  Now it's going to write out something like:

  Serif SansSerif Monospaced Dialog DialogInput ACaslonPro-Bold...

  To get the old behavior, use printArray(). It's the price of progress, 
  and shouldn't really "break" anyone's code since it's just writing to the
  console. We think the new syntax outweighs the downside of the change. 

  With arrays of primitive types (int[], float[], anything that's not an
  object), we've added code so that println() works as before. But we
  can't do the same for arrays of objects, such as String. 

+ The preference for font smoothing (anti-aliasing) in the editor has been
  reset in this release. Fonts are unusably gross on OS X (and Linux) 
  without smoothing and Oracle's version of Java (now in use with 2.1),
  and many longtime users have anti-aliasing turned off. You can still 
  turn off smoothing in the Preferences window, but the results may be poor.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2164
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2160


[ bug fixes ]

+ Fix dataPath() problem with OS X (was breaking Movie on export)

+ Command line processing-java was broken in 2.1 beta 1 on OS X
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2159

+ Fix a situation where processing-java would return 0 instead of 1 on errors
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1798#issuecomment-26711847

+ Alpha values from the pixels array were coming back as 0
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2030

+ Additional UI font tweaks due to decreased legibility with Oracle Java
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2135


[ OpenGL updates ] 

+ Using sketchQuality() does not work properly with P3D, OPENGL, P2D
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2157

+ Fix crashes when the sketch window is resized
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1880
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2156

+ scale() wasn't affecting stroke weight in P3D
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2162

+ Add set(boolean) to PShader
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1991
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/1993

+ Add PMatrix.preApply(PMatrix)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2146
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2145

+ Updated to another version of JOGL (jogl-2.1-b1115, gluegen-2.1-b735)
  for OS X 10.9 support.

+ Add warning when no uv texture coordinates are supplied
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2034

+ Flicker issues when resizing P2D/P3D/OPENGL
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/15

+ Additional fix for occasional flash/flicker with drawing complex scenes
  https://github.com/processing/processing/commit/cca2f08a24ef892c494f5a75aa0e4b01de7e5d8a

PROCESSING 2.1 beta 1 (REV 0222) - 20 October 2013

This release contains major changes. The big ones:

+ Java 7 is now used across all platforms. On Mac OS X, 
  we're now embedding Java 7u45. More info here:
  http://wiki.processing.org/w/Supported_Platforms#Java_Versions

+ Major changes have been made to Export to Application. 
  Read here: http://wiki.processing.org/w/Export_Info_and_Tips

+ print() and println() now make debugging fun! They can now take any 
  number of parameters, which means that code like:
  println(x, y, mouseX, mouseY);
  will print out
  3 5 142 220
  No more println(x + " " +  y + " " + mouseX + " " + mouseY);
  that was for suckers!

+ A new serial library has been added! The results of Gottfried Haider's
  Google Summer of Code project now replaces the old serial library.

And everyone should wish Casey Reas happy birthday today! 
This release is my birthday present for him. What did you get him?

Here's a more detailed rundown of what else is in this release:


[ new features and additions ] 

+ For people using Eclipse, the new print() and println() methods add
  some quirks because of how println() works for arrays in previous
  versions of Processing. When printing an array, you should instead use
  the new printArray() function, which works the same as the old println().
  This will help avoid the compiler warnings with Eclipse and others.
  In the PDE, this should be transparent, because warnings are not shown.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2056

+ Update the JavaDoc, remove java.* package prefix ugliness. Also link
  out to the online version of the Oracle documentation. 

+ Major work on the source and the build scripts as we completed the 
  transition to Java 7, and away from Apple's deprecated Java 6.
  http://wiki.processing.org/w/Supported_Platforms#Mac_OS_X

+ Incorporated a version of Oracle's appbundler for OS X build. Made heavy
  modifications to the original version to add features and simplify.

+ Culled un-needed resources from the Java 7 runtime to save space.
  Unfortunately Java 7 is also much larger than Java 6, so the size change
  isn't as considerable as we would hope.

+ Remove unused/outdated 'Mangler' Tool example

+ Remove video library for other platforms in download. This saves 
  significant space because we're not doing cross-platform export anymore.

+ Update apple.jar file with new version
  https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/samplecode/AppleJavaExtensions/Introduction/Intro.html

+ Update build instructions on Github
  https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Build-Instructions
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1629

+ Many changes to the Supported Platforms page
  http://wiki.processing.org/w/Supported_Platforms

+ Updates to the Export page to cover changes in this release
  http://wiki.processing.org/w/Export_Info_and_Tips

+ Removed the 32- and 64-bit selector from the Preferences on OS X.
  Java 7 on OS X only supports 64-bit, so 32-bit is no longer available.


[ editor fixes ] 

+ Deal with null/missing folders for Tools and Modes
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2068

+ Non-compliant libraries cause crash on "Add Library"
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2026

+ Bad tools could bring down the environment
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=798
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/836

+ Open new PDE maximized when current PDE is maximized
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2037

+ cmd-left was bringing up the text area popup, causing X Mode weirdness
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2103


[ core bug fixes ]

+ Screen stops updating sometimes with retina displays on OS X
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1699
  This was an Apple bug, and is fixed by our switch to Oracle's Java 7.

+ Background color for present mode had no effect
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2071
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2072

+ Fix image transparency in PDF output
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2070

+ Java2D images crash after being resized
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2113

+ Constrain lerpColor() between 0 and 1. Unlike lerp(), where it might 
  make mathematical sense, going outside the boundary colors produces 
  really messy results.

+ JSONObject/Array.format(-1) not working on embedded JSONObjects
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2119

+ Fix insertRow() bug with Table
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2137

+ 64-bit version of serial library
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1237
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1275

+ Closed several serial bugs because they're no longer relevant:

PROCESSING 2.0.2 (REV 0220) - 14 August 2013

Many small bug fixes and lots of work on the Library/Tool/Mode Manager. 
Full screen is back for Windows, and lots more.

+ Fix Windows issues with associating .pde files 
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/286
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=247

+ Present Mode does not work properly on Windows
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1955

  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1994

+ Fix "less less" typo 
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1928

+ Slash breaks syntax highlighting when spaces are involved
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1681
  Fix from Github user hamzaissa - thanks!

+ selectInput() in exported OS X sketch treats .app package as a folder
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1959

+ Code with a NUL character causes an error
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1973
  Also remove NUL characters when loading PDE files

+ Allow delete of files in unsaved sketches
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1942
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/1945

+ UnsatisfiedLinkError was causing huge/unreadable message

+ selectInput() in exported OS X sketch treats .app package as a folder
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1959

+ Retain blendMode() between frames
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1962


[ contribution managers ] 

+ Support multiple categories for libraries
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1970

+ Notify users that Modes and Tools require restart.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1782
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1504
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1466

+ Change the location of the manager download to something more stable.

+ Restrict library categories to the ones in the document. If it's not
  correct, shows up as 'other'.

+ Catch Errors (not just Exceptions) when loading libraries, modes, 
  and tools. Handles UnsupportedClassVersionError and other quirks.

+ Redo handling of "old" versions of contributions.

+ Update example list when library is installed
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1909
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/1925


[ data, data, data ] 

+ Error in IntList and FloatList insert()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1929

+ Add a sort() method to Table.

+ Implement version of Table that takes a dictionary file. Syntax is:
  Table t = loadTable("bigdata.tsv", "dictionary=bigdata-dict.tsv")
  This allows you to set the data type of columns before loading, which
  provides much better performance and lower memory usage.

+ Constructing table from an Iterator is missing
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1956

+ Add sum() to IntList and FloatList
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1893

+ When using increment() on IntList, make sure the index exists and
  automatically resize the list if necessary. This is more in keeping 
  with increment() in the Dict classes.

+ getSubset() broken in IntList, StringList, and missing from FloatList
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1979

+ Add join() method to Int/Float/StringList

+ Add getContent(defaultValue) to XML

+ Add isNull() (returns boolean) to JSONObject/Array

+ Add getXxxx(xxx, defaultValue) methods to JSONObject/Array
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2007


[ internal changes you'll never notice... unless I broke something ] 

+ Add an exception wrapper for startup, hopefully we can catch/debug
  more "Processing can't start!" issues with this.

+ Update JNA from 3.2.4 to 3.5.2.

+ Updated JOGL to 2.0.2.

+ Added methods to move files to Trash/Recycle Bin where available.

+ Implement basic proxy server support for update checking and the
  contribution managers.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1476

+ Basic getShape(ch) implementation for font glyph shapes. Not finished
  and (therefore) not yet documented.

+ Change QUAD_BEZIER_VERTEX to QUADRATIC_VERTEX to match the API call
  (because this lives inside PConstants).

+ Add retina switch for PApplet to set useActive with OS X and 7u40.
  Prevents speed/performance issues with old sketches on retina macs.

+ Add error message for raspberry pi (and others?) about int buffers
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2010


[ changes ] 

+ Experimental Mode has been removed from the default download, 
  so that it can be updated more frequently. Install it and help us

PROCESSING 2.0 (REV 0218) - 3 June 2013

And just like that, here we are at 2.0. 

[ bug fixes ] 

+ Example window has the Java application icon
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1800

+ The update checker sometimes insisted there were updates, 
  even though there were not, due to a build problem.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1792

+ Removed the 'modes' folder from the sketchbook listing
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1832

+ Add return code to processing-java on Linux
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1798

+ Command line tool on OS X was broken due to classpath problems.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1787

+ saveJSONArray() loops forever, triggers error
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1827

+ patch to make font textures smaller in P2D/P3D
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/1775

+ .png data written when .jpg file specified with save/saveFrame()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1810

+ remove() broken in the List classes
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1826

+ PGraphics objects that used JAVA2D weren't updating when used with OpenGL
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1786

+ P2D/P3D sketches don't get focus until clicked
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1700

[ changes ] 

+ A handful of tweaks to smooth out the 2.0 user interface. 
  Incorporates some of the feedback suggested here: 
  https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/1822
  while trying to preserve the look & feel of our PDE design.

+ Added built-in fonts (Source Sans and Source Code from Adobe)
  as the default font for the UI and editor. As usual, the editor 
  font can be changed in preferences.txt. And if you already have 
  a preferences.txt file, the new font won't override it. Fonts
  for GUI elements can be modified in lib/theme.txt, but be careful
  with those, and don't complain if/when they break.

+ Added several additional functions for data classes. More details 
  in the reference and coming soon.

+ Changed how null values were handled with binary tables. If anyone
  was using the (undocument) .bin format for Table, you'll need to 
  re-save your data.

+ Changed XML.toString() (what's called when you print() or println() 
  an XML object) to just send a single line of text instead of a full 
  XML document with a header. Use format(numSpaces) if you want a
  properly formatted document with declaration at the top.

[ andres on the attack ] 

+ PImage not drawn after resize()/get() in P2D/P3D
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1830

+ Can't disable textures for loaded OBJ shapes (2b9)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1825

+ Can't mask PGraphics with another PGraphics
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1738

+ PGL.readPixels() causes "invalid operation" error
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1666

+ Strange behavior of PGraphics pixels[] when using P2D and P3D renderer
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1815

+ PShape setVertex has a memory leak
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1670

+ PGL lacks a wrapper for the alphaFunc() method and the ALPHA_TEST constant
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1703

+ Implement textMode(SHAPE) for 3D
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/777

+ An internal change so that PImage.loadPixels() doesn't call the renderer.
  Fixes some odd quirks in saveFrame() and other draw/get/save operations.

+ Setting smooth(n) affects disables background in setup()
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1452

+ textureWrap(REPEAT) + textureMode(IMAGE) clamps positive coordinates
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1809

+ P2D, P3D drawing errors in static mode, gray screen
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1648

+ Window shorter than 127 pixels high is not rendered correctly in P2D/P3D

PROCESSING 2.0b9 (REV 0217) - 18 May 2013

The 2.0 interface has arrived! Mmm... pretty.

We've removed Android and JavaScript modes from the default download. You 
can easily install them by selected "Add Mode" from the Mode menu. They've
been removed because the changes have not kept pace with the rest of 
Processing, and it was holding up the release of 2.0. As separate projects, 
we hope it'll be easier for volunteers to get involved, rather than our
tiny, worn out development team. View the projects here:
https://github.com/fjenett/javascript-mode-processing
https://github.com/processing/processing-android

There are also lots of goodies in the new data classes found in the
processing.data package that will make it much easier to handle data from
inside Processing. More documentation coming soon!

We're hoping this is the last beta before 2.0, but we're still haggling
with one or two issues that could require a beta 10. That's a lot of beta.

[ fixes ] 

+ Major OutOfMemoryError problem with images fixed by Andres!
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1353
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1391

+ Lots of fixes for the library/mode/tool manager. 
  Repairing colors, layout, etc. along with lots of internal fixes.

+ Fix MovieMaker, it was completely broken
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1669

+ processing-java dialog window was huge
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1748

+ Library with bad version number in version causes stack trace to print. 
  Added warning message about it with a pointer to the remedy.

+ "New version available" mesage is showing HTML tags around it
   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1684

+ "Update" not working in the manager
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1701

+ tint() with JAVA2D does not automatically refresh (with possible fix)
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1730

+ Lines not properly renderered in P3D when using ortographic projection
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1661

+ Fix JSON and get it working properly. Now official API.
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1660
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1680

+ Plus dozens of other P2D/P3D fixes that Andres snuck in there.

+ Last lines of a beginShape(LINES) are invisible in the P2D renderer
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1761

+ Incorrect number of vertices on beginShape(TRIANGLES) affect subsequent Shapes
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1760

+ Rendering unlit geometry with TEXLIGHT shader throws misleading error message
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1757

[ changes ]

+ New images for modes. New design!

+ Added loadJSONArray(), loadJSONObject. 

+ Hundreds of changes to the new data classes, sorting out their API, etc.

+ Fix autoformat to indent like the p5 book/examples. Thanks pif!
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=325
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/364

+ Removed netscape.javascript stuff that was only relevant for applets

+ Change error message for libraries (especially serial) for 32- vs 64-bit
  to clarify that the 32- or 64-bit version of Processing can be used instead.

+ Rebuilt the internal Runner to use SocketAttach... This may bring up 
  a firewall message on some machines. Don't worry, it's safe (as long as
  the message is showing up when you hit Run, that's expected).

+ Add set(x, y) to PVector. 

+ Removed div() and mult() from PVector, since not a legit math operation.
  https://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1506
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1544

+ loadImage() with TGA causing images to be upside-down
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1682

+ Added getIntContent(), getFloatContent() to XML

+ Table switch to CATEGORY instead of CATEGORICAL (not documented)

+ removed createXML() and createTable()... just use 'new' for these

+ Add official API for mouse wheel support
  https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1461
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1423

+ Incorporated JDI changes from Manindra. This makes the download a little
  larger, but is a step toward being able to have a simpler download that
  only requires a JRE (and is therefore much smaller!)

PROCESSING 2.0b7 (REV 0215) - 7 December 2012

475,382 bug fixes in this release as we work on finalizing 2.0. 

[ changes ] 

+ Removed all imports that aren't covered in the Processing reference. 
  If you use java.awt, java.util, or other classes in your sketch, you
  will need to add an import line to the beginning of your sketch.

  Only the classes that are covered in the reference (HashMap, ArrayList, 
  and some others) are now imported by default. This has been done to improve
  overall cross-platform parity and to avoid users unknowingly adding 
  Java classes, and then the sadness that comes when switching to Android
  or JavaScript modes. 

  The list of imports is now hard-coded (no longer read from preferences.txt)
  and includes the following:
  import java.util.HashMap;
  import java.util.ArrayList;
  import java.io.BufferedReader;
  import java.io.PrintWriter;
  import java.io.InputStream;
  import java.io.OutputStream;
  import java.io.IOException;

  If we're missing anything that's covered in the reference, please let us 
  know via the bugs database.

+ A new "experimental" mode has been added. It's the start of combining two
  of our Google Summer of Code projects (DebugMode and XQMode) to enable 
  a debugger and on-the-fly error checking. We're including it in the release
  so that folks can test it out and let us know how it's doing. The interface
  still needs work and its innards may be a bit buggy, but it represents
  some exciting upcoming improvements for the PDE.

+ hint(ENABLE_ACCURATE_2D) has been renamed to hint(DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_STROKE)
  to better reflect what it actually does. Reference has been added.
  OpenGL drawing is significantly faster when the fill and stroke of a shape
  is drawn separately. This leads to visual artifacts on shapes where both
  fill and stroke is enabled (not a great idea in 3D anyway), so this option
  fixes the visual artifacts at the expense of speed.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1302

+ Sketch names can no longer begin with underscores (fixes an Android
  compatibility issue). This was changed in recent releases, but missing here.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=859

+ More Mac OS X key bindings have been implemented in the editor:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1354
  http://guides.macrumors.com/Keyboard_shortcuts&section=10#Text_Shortcuts

+ Set quality level higher when exporting JPEG images. This will result 
  in larger JPEG files with save() and saveFrame(), but the default quality 
  setting in the past was unacceptable for many/most projects. 
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=58
  See the bug report link for how to implement in case you want to set 
  the quality lower (or even higher) than the new default.

+ Table row iterating syntax has changed. This code:
  for (TableRow row : table) { ... }
  has now changed to 
  for (TableRow row : table.getRows()) { ... }
  (This may change to rows() on the next round, pending other API tweaks)

+ Change default for shift-backspace to just be backspace. To change it back,
  set editor.keys.shift_backspace_is_delete=true in preferences.txt.

+ Implement clip() and noClip() to set the clipping region.

+ Added blendMode() feature.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1385

+ Add different styles of arc drawing.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=711
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1406

+ Added XML.getLong() (also updated Android)
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1378

+ Implement back-buffer sampler in OpenGL renderers.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1169

+ Change how get(x, y, w, h) was handled with offscreen areas.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=925

+ Make key and mouse events interleave, also improve threading.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=79

+ Changed event constants to PRESS, RELEASE, CLICK, DRAG, MOVE, ENTER, EXIT
  instead of past-tense versions of the same.

+ Removed mask(int[]) from PImage.

+ Implement postEvent() to put new events on the queue.

+ Add mouseEntered/Exited on the desktop.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=500

+ Change output from processing-java to be UTF-8 encoded.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1418

+ Disable Quartz renderer to fix line blending problem on OS X. 
  This older renderer was faster but had some bugs, like one that
  caused lines to composite incorrectly when alpha was used. 
  Add "PApplet.useQuartz = true;" into your PApplet.main() 
  function to switch back to the old method:
  http://processing.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/processing/build/javadoc/core/processing/core/PApplet.html#useQuartz

+ Remove requirement for Google APIs in Android mode.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=613


[ bug fixes ] 

+ mouseButton not being set properly in mouseClicked.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1350

+ mouseButton is 0 in mouseReleased() on OS X
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1373

+ mousePressed() coloring now different from mousePressed
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=41
  Still not necessarily perfect, but it's a big improvement.
  Note for people implementing their own Modes: FUNCTION1 and 
  FUNCTION2 have now been added for functions with parens.

+ 32-bit mode / 64-bit mode preference was ignored on OS X.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1426

+ Prevent errors on first line of a new tab from highlighting the last 
  line of the previous tab. In particular, a single letter on a new tab 
  was highlighting the last line of the tab to its left.

+ Android debug information wasn't being passed through to the console. 
  In addition, on Windows, error reporting wasn't working properly
  (couldn't find the right line or report the error correctly).
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1440

+ Fix ugly results from resize() command on PImage:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=332
  and similar on Android:

  due to conflicts w/ the new event system, and hoping to enforce better
  cross-platform compatibility between Java, JavaScript, and Android modes.

+ Changed event handling to hopefully clean up some inconsistencies.
  Removed motionX/Y/Pressure... these need to be handled separately.

PROCESSING 2.0b6 (REV 0214) - 2 November 2012

Patching up command line issues that went backwards in the last release, 
a number of OpenGL fixes, and more internal changes and updates. 

[ bug fixes ] 

+ Command line support was broken in 2.0b5, with an error about
  processing-java ClassNotFoundException: BatchCompiler
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1334
  On Mac OS X, you may need to re-run the "Install Command Line" tool.

+ Make sure the sketchbook is being picked up on the command line,
  so that imported libraries are handled correctly.

+ Import statements were executed within multiline comments.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=911

+ Editor not responding properly if the "External Editor" preference
  had been enabled with a previous release. 
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1355

+ A number of OpenGL fixes to better handle older chipsets, like the
  GMA 950 (found on lots of older Mac Minis and similar hardware). 

+ Reverted back to an older version of the JOGL library to prevent
  issues with sketches locking up. In particular, this should fix 
  sketches that use the video library: 
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1338
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1364

+ Icon loading was causing an error if you used a package for your code.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1346

+ No longer using --request on OS X 10.6, since it's not available. 
  Avoids a harmless warning message on the console when running a sketch.

[ changes/additions ] 

+ Added an option to Preferences to enable/disable advanced input method
  support to handle complex scripts like Japanese, Korean, or Chinese.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=526

+ Add option for blinking and/or block caret in the editor. To disable 
  caret blinking in the text editor, add this line to preferences.txt:
  editor.caret.blink = true
  Or to just a block caret, use this:
  editor.caret.block = false
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1136

[ internal ]

+ Removed applet-related preferences, and the 'applet' subfolder in the 
  source/distribution.

+ Removed the old 'cmd' folder from the source/distribution

+ Preferences are now written in sorted order to make it easier to handle
  comparisons or other debugging.

+ Major change to handle how the 'lib' folder is found, hopefully does a 
  better job with command line support.

PROCESSING 2.0b5 (REV 0213) - 22 October 2012

Fixes for a few regressions that showed up in 2.0b4, plus some internal
changes to simplify how modes are handled.

[ bug fixes ] 

+ Libraries not installed through IDE had blank names.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1331

+ mouseButton not being set properly on Windows (and probably Linux).
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1332

+ Console disappearing with increased editor font size.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1275

[ changes/internal ] 

+ Change how modes are set up so that XQMode, our Google Summer of Code
  project can work properly.

+ Implement multiple sizes of icons for PDE and core. This improves 
  the quality of the icon seen on Windows and Linux attached to frames.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=632

PROCESSING 2.0b4 (REV 0212) - 21 October 2012

Command line support is back! Find and Replace works over multiple tabs!
The Mac OS X version should work again in spite of Apple's best efforts!

[ additions & removals ] 

+ Command line support is now available for Java mode. On Windows and Linux, 
  use the processing-java program. On Mac OS X, there's an option in the 
  Tools menu to install the command line tool. 
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=142

  Build and export options should even work in headless mode when enabled
  (no guarantees, but simple test results were promising).
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=220

  Android and JavaScript mode are not supported, contributions are welcome:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1323

+ Added a Tool for Mac OS X to help set up serial port. Using serial on 
  OS X requires some incantations on the command line, and this prompts for
  an administrator password and takes care of them for you. The commands
  involve creating a folder and setting a few permissions. If everything 
  is already set properly, the Tool will not be present in the Tools menu.

+ With the arrival of command line support, the misunderstood and sometimes
  maligned "Use External Editor" option has been removed. 
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=515

+ Fix several problems introduced by Apple's recent Java "update".
  Apple's most recent Java update may render older versions of Processing
  completely unusable, it's not quite clear yet. 

[ bug fixes ] 

+ Fix the exceptionally slow startup (a 5 second delay) in recent releases.

+ Find & Replace over multiple tabs (thanks to Manindra Moharana for the patch!)
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=25

+ calling jump() resets movie speed
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1303

+ Fixed sketch renaming regression in underscore handling
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1310

+ Fix library manager temporary folder problem on Linux)
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1295

+ Default sketchbook folder was going to wrong location on Linux
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1286

+ mouseButton wasn't getting set on mouseReleased()
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1294

[ technical updates ] 

+ JOGL has been updated, which may help iron out some GL quirks.

+ Change all build.xml files to use Java 6 as both source and target
  (avoids Java 7 warnings during build).

+ Updated ecj.jar to use jdt-core.jar... This is a larger file but were 
  hoping that this would get our GSoC project "XQMode" working without
  the need for patches. Sadly that's not the case, but stay tuned.

[ known issues ] 

+ Fewer exclamation points will be used to introduce future releases.

PROCESSING 2.0b3 (REV 0211) - 10 September 2012

Shaking out the beta bugs.

[ major fixes ] 

+ registerMethod("keyEvent", ...) not calling key event methods.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1225

+ "Processing is damaged and should be put in the trash" with 2.0b2.
  Apple's asinine code signing strikes back!
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1226

+ Restore deprecated versions of getFont() and getImage() to address
  library compatibility issues. The similar getBitmap() and getTypeface() 
  methods on Android will not be restored.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1223

[ minor fixes ] 

+ Changing the default display in Preferences does not reset editor 
  location, so it appears to have no effect.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1162

+ Remove bad cast in PGL during error reporting.

+ Make Mode menu into a radio button, so it cannot be de-selected
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1227

[ changes and additions ] 

+ Show error message when using createGraphics() with P2D, P3D, or OPENGL
  and the main drawing surface is not an OpenGL renderer.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1217

+ Make file selectable from the OS X menu bar. Thanks to Hansi for the
  patch. Note that this only works for sketches that have been saved.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1215

+ Added registerMethod(keyEvent) to Android, though motion and mouse
  events are still unavailable.

+ Cleaning up the internals of Preferences and untitled sketches.
  Fingers crossed that these don't give us last-minute regressions.

PROCESSING 2.0b2 (REV 0210) - 7 September 2012

One major fix for libraries that use key events, and a number of minor 
fixes that we've found along the way. 

[ fixes and updates ] 

+ Libraries with using key events were reporting:
  "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: argument type mismatch"
  in beta 1, this is now fixed. 

+ Added hint(ENABLE_STROKE_PURE) to deal with Java 2D regression.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1137

+ Fix for stroke with beginShape(TRIANGLE_FAN)
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1137

+ hint() documentation now updated (except for the hint above). 
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1144

+ Using ortho() breaks stroke rendering
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1207

[ fixed earlier ] 

+ POINTS mode vertices are huge

+ Potentially insufficient ellipse detail with P3D/OPENGL when scaled
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=87

+ Implement support for complex shapes when using the OpenGL renderer 
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=122

+ modelX/Y/Z broken when aiming a camera
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=148

+ Memory improvements for updatePixels() with OpenGL (P2D and P3D)
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=77

+ Text characters showing up as opaque rectangles

+ Changing framerate causes program to crash with P2D in 2.0a6
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1116

[ android ] 

+ Updated examples from Andres and categories in the examples browser.

PROCESSING 2.0b1 (REV 0209) - 3 September 2012

Bug fixes, new registered methods for libraries, updated keywords,
and we're beta!

[ changes ] 

+ Require 10.6.8 as minimum Mac OS X system version. 

+ Change name from "Standard" to "Java" mode.

+ Save opened/closed state of entries in the examples browser
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=827

+ Lots of internal changes to loadShape() and PShape. 

+ Work on making API more generic and consistent for cross-platform use.
  Font PFont.getFont() -> Object PFont.getNative()
  Typeface PFont.getTypeface() -> Object PFont.getNative()
  Image PImage.getImage() -> Object PImage.getNative()
  Bitmap PImage.getBitmap() -> Object PImage.getNative()

+ beginGL() and endGL() are gone, and beginPGL() and endPGL() exist 
  in their place. The PGL class is a layer that lets us talk to 
  OpenGL in a way that's cross-platform and consistent. It also has
  many GL calls for people who want to access GL directly.

+ New syntax introduced for libraries and registered methods. 
  Documentation coming soon.

[ bug fixes ] 

+ Handle dimming the Find/Replace buttons.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1056

+ Any double-click inside Examples window opened the last selection on Windows

+ GL Android sketches halting after rotation.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1146

[ known issues ] 

+ createShape() is not implemented with the default 2D renderer.

+ See the Changes page on the Wiki for more.

PROCESSING 2.0a9 (REV 0208) - 1 September 2012

As we inch closer to beta, a quick release for testing. 

Plenty of video and OpenGL graphics fixes from Andres, and some functions
disappearing due to cleanups by Ben. (Andres giveth, Ben taketh away). 

Consider this one to be 'nightly build' quality. 

[ general ] 

+ Help menu broken when Processing has spaces in its path name in 2.0a8
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1164

+ We now have repeating textures. Use textureWrap(CLAMP) (the usual
  version) or textureWrap(REPEAT). If this feature is used for evil
  and cheesiness, it will be removed in future releases. 
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=94

+ Fix lights in GL renderers on low-end android devices.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1145

+ Pixels for createGraphics() now transparent for P2D, P3D.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1156

[ video ] 

+ GettingStartedCapture in 2.0a8 launches X11 in Mountain Lion
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1191

+ Some videos were giving OpenGL error with P2D/P3D.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1166

+ Jump movie to multiple of the framerate for better accuracy.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1182

+ Movie functions not working correctly in setup().
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1181

+ Fix initialization API for Capture.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1184

+ Some movie examples were not working in P2D, P3D in 2.0a8
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1178

+ Wrong resolutions reported by Capture.list()
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1192

[ advanced ] 

+ Several constants moved out of PConstants and into PGraphics.

+ API cleanup to PShape and unapproved methods.

+ Synchronized Android sources a bit (PShape, PConstants, etc.)

+ Removed several video functions that weren't approved.


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 


PROCESSING 2.0a8 (REV 0207) - 5 August 2012

A handful of bug fixes. Not as large a release as 2.0a7, but I decided 
it best to get the updates out there and in use rather than waiting for
beta 1 since I'm not sure when we'll be able to get that out. 

[ miscellaneous ] 

+ Make sure smooth() is the default with both renderers
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1157

+ "Open" dialog on Linux wasn't showing directories
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1151

+ Double-click was immediately closing example folder (Windows and Linux)
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1150

+ Support native code in Android libraries. Thanks to m4rlonj for the patch!
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1117

+ Don't expand the folders in the examples window (Casey request)

+ Added cmd-shift-O (ctrl-shift-O) for opening examples window

+ Added recent sketches menu to the toolbar

+ Added 'empty sketchbook' indicator when the sketchbook menus are empty

+ Prevent users from deleting the last tab on the only sketch that is 
  currently open on Windows and Linux. 

[ serial ] 

+ Added 64-bit RXTX for Mac OS X serial from this page:
  http://blog.iharder.net/2009/08/18/rxtx-java-6-and-librxtxserial-jnilib-on-intel-mac-os-x/

+ Added warning message on Mac OS X when /var/lock folders aren't available
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=944
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=937

+ bufferUntil() with values above 127 do not work properly
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1079

[ plumbing ] 

+ Switch to using java.awt.Desktop classes for opening folders, links, etc.

+ Include createTextArea() in Editor for the GSOC projects.

+ Add code for setting the L&F from the prefs file for Linux.

+ Added 'all tabs' checkbox to Find & Replace, but not implemented yet.
  This would be a great project for someone to finish:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=25

+ Added notes about "color(0, 0, 0, 0) produces black" to the Wiki.

PROCESSING 2.0a7 (REV 0206) - 29 July 2012

Hopefully the last alpha before we hit 2.0 beta. 

The big change is that we're dropping support for applets in 2.0, and in
this release. See the Changes section of the Wiki for details. We've not
updated all of the documentation to reflect this yet.

OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion support has also been added, by virtue of our 
paying $99/year for the privilege of releasing our free and open source
application on OS X. When run on 10.8, versions prior to 2.0a7 would report
that they were corrupt, invalid, or not trusted. Which is definitely us. 

[ editor ] 

+ Implemented a "Recent Sketches" menu. This replaces re-opening 
  sketches on startup, which behaved inconsistently anyway. 
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=188

+ Use Swing file choosers by default on Linux. The default open/save
  dialogs provided by Java are pretty gruesome, so we're switching to 
  the Swing JFileChooser instead. To swap the behavior, set 
  'chooser.files.native' in your preferences.txt file.

+ Suppress "invalid context 0x0" and "invalid drawable" because they're
  (unfixable) Apple Java bugs and being reported as Processing bugs.
  Also suppress XInitThreads message on Linux with JOGL, which is a
  JOGL bug that'll hopefully be fixed in their next release.

+ Fix Movie Maker tool on OS X.

+ Update to Java 6 update 33 on Windows and Linux.

+ Add separate 32- and 64-bit releases for Windows and Linux. Lots of other
  updates for 32/64-bit support in general.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=955

+ Replace processing.exe with a more standard version from launch4j, 
  which should hopefully clean up some launcher issues.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=943
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=176

+ Change how sketches open so that there's no longer differences between
  the File menu 'Open' and the way it worked from the toolbar. Simplifies 
  additional code that was quirky.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1034

+ Add a warning dialog for libraries that aren't compatible.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=884

+ Fix up the file choosers used on Linux.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1014

+ Instead of prompting for sketchbook location on Linux, just default to
  a folder named 'sketchbook' in the user's home directory. This can easily
  be changed later but simplifies things internally a bit. 

+ No longer allow underscore at beginning of sketch name (causes problems 
  with Android, and also with applets, though we care less about those...)
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1047

+ Fixed a problem where sanitized names (underscores replacing unusable 
  characters) could potentially overwrite existing folders.

[ core ] 

+ Major changes to selectInput(), selectOutput(), and selectFolder(). 
  See the Wiki: http://wiki.processing.org/w/Changes#Change_and_Removed
  The changes are there to prevent a threading bug:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=173
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=931
  And also include an option to set the default file path:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=233

+ Change 'appletViewer' back to 'online'. Still deprecated, especially
  because applets are going away. 

+ Add begin/endGL added to PGraphics/PApplet. 

+ Add hasChildren() to XML library.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1045

+ Fix where displayWidth/Height not being set properly before setup()
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1120

+ XML now throws exceptions in its constructor (for advanced users). 
  Use loadXML() instead of "new XML(this, ....)" 
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1138

+ loadXML() returns null when the file did not open properly
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1138

+ ortho() causing line and fill to be misaligned
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1143

+ Add some extra options for PApplet.main() for advanced users:
  PApplet.main("SketchName") and PApplet.main("SketchName", args) 

[ android ] 

+ Add full PAppletMethods implementation to Android, so that PGraphics  
  and PImage methods are brought into PApplet.

+ Swap Run on Device and Run on Emulator
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1083

+ Fix XML crash on loading because of desktop-specific attribute
  error: "http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd"
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1128
  This also fixes PShape on Android:

+ Built in Hansi's full screen API for OS X, so that sketches can use
  full screen without exclusive mode. See the Wiki for details.
  http://wiki.processing.org/w/Window_Size_and_Full_Screen

PROCESSING 2.0a5 (REV 0204) - 23 March 2012

Major updates in this release include a huge revamp of the OpenGL library
by Andres, fixes to get Android Mode working again, and a number of bug 
fixes and additions as we head toward 2.0.

Unfortunately, however, Android mode is still broken on Windows.
http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1022

On the OpenGL front, we're working to have a single library that works 
across both desktop and mobile, which is good news because it means we have 
a fighting chance of making it work (rather than maintaining two entire sets 
of a very complicated set of code), but the downside is that it requires 
newer versions of OpenGL on both the desktop and mobile, so it may cause 
problems with old OSes, mediocre graphics drivers, etc that worked with 
earlier releases.

[ bug fixes ] 

+ OpenGL applets are working again.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=845

+ Abnormal high Java CPU usage at empty sketch with draw() 
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=729

+ "Framingham" example has BufferOverflowException
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=900

+ Repeatedly calling texture() with new image raises memory error
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=806

+ Doc comments not being properly terminated in export of applet
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=877

+ Tweaks to the code to prevent multiple copies of Processing from 
  running at once.

+ Fix bug with 'base' not getting set in the Mac OS X platform class.

+ Syntax highlighting not case sensitive in 1.5 through 2.0+
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=913

+ Fix problem with application export on Linux
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=945

+ Fix PImage.get() issue with width or height < 0.

+ (Mostly failed) attempts to improve the performance of tint() with Java2D.

+ Fix so that normals aren't attempted when no texture is set.

+ Several bug fixes inside Table as they relate to inserting/adding columns.

[ changes/additions ] 

+ Enable smooth() by default.

+ Added setContent() to the XML library, other tweaks to XML export.

+ Make note of when library is not available (serial) with error msg
  i.e. if running in 64-bit mode on OS X, can't do serial

+ Update to Java 6u29 for Linux and Windows (OS X now updated).

+ Don't show library conflict warning until someone tries to build 
  with code that actually calls on one of those packages.

+ urlEncode() and urlDecode() added (docs coming later).

+ delay() is back again. F*king delay().

+ Added anti-alias methods so that FSAA can set up properly. The API for
  these is not set yet. 

[ in earlier releases ] 

+ Commenting via menu or shortcut does not set sketch to "need save".
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=860

+ Moved the data folder outside the main jar in exported applications.
  Otherwise enormous files are sometimes added to the jar, which makes
  things needlessly slow.

+ Create new MovieMaker tool to write uncompressed QuickTime movies.
  www.randelshofer.ch/blog/2010/10/writing-quicktime-movies-in-pure-java

+ Library imports failing for libs that define the same packages in 1.5.1
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=725

+ Closing applet window in Processing 1.5 causes serial crash.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=635

[ javascript ] 

+ Finalize JavaScript mode export folder name.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=848

+ Intermittent hangs of PDE when launching JavaScript Server
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=936

PROCESSING 2.0a4 (REV 0203) - 10 November 2011

This is just a quick release so that I can procrastinate on packing for
Chicago a little longer. A handful of bug fixes here:

+ Video capture was broken in 2.0a3 on OS X due to an issue with the build 
  process. Should be all set now.

+ Fixed incessant "inefficient font rendering" debug message on Android.

+ Fixed android/code/build.xml to point at the correct SDK version.

+ Changing between 32- and 64- bit mode on OS X wasn't properly reloading
  library paths. Now it should pick up the necessary 32- and 64-bit version
  of a library that's needed. (However there are still no useful error
  messages when natives aren't available for the platform--just an
  UnsatisfiedLinkError when you try to run. Will fix.)

[ andres' bug victims ] 

+ Multiple calls to curve() connect subsequent curves with lines in P3D/OPENGL
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=865

+ Arc not drawn in P3D and OpenGL mode (2.0a2)
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=890

PROCESSING 2.0a3 (REV 0202) - 5 November 2011

Some weekend bug fixing and regression repair for the recent alpha releases.

Also several Android fixes to get things working again with more recent 
updates from Google. You'll need to upgrade to this version of Processing 
in order to continue using Android mode.

[ environment ] 

+ Fix problem with serial not loading on Mac OS X.

+ Fix problem with popup menus on the toolbar disappearing immediately
  when used on Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion).
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=846
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=887

+ Incorrect tab/line shown for preprocessor errors when more than 2 tabs
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=873

+ Commenting via menu or shortcut does not set sketch to "need save"
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=766

  an Android version by including an 'android' subfolder.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=766

+ Fix problem with export menu, keys, toolbar being different.

+ Change default package name a bit.

+ Switch to SDK 8 (Android 2.2) as the minimum that we're supporting.
  This allows us to rely on far more consistent OpenGL implementations.

+ Update the project files for Android SDK Tools Revision 15 (now required)
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=876

+ Improve launching with the emulator.

+ Remove 'includeantruntime' warning during build.

PROCESSING 2.0a2 (REV 0201) - 31 October 2011

Happy Halloween! I'll be dressing up as an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

This release is primarily focused on the new video library and making it
usable across platforms. It also has some changes for how applications 
are exported, and a number of other bug fixes and tweaks.

[ platforms ] 

+ With this release, Java 1.6 is now required. We will no longer be 
  supporting Java 1.5.

+ In perhaps related news, we are no longer supporting Mac OS X 10.5.
  We have to support 10.6 and 10.7 across both 32- and 64-bit, and adding
  yet another to that is simply not possible.

[ 32- and 64-bit support is a nightmare ]

+ A great deal of effort is being put into supporting the emergence of
  64-bit. Library support has changed significantly to get things working,
  more on this coming soon.

+ Serial on Mac OS X and Windows is currently only available for 32-bit. 
  Hoping someone can help us support a 64-bit version sometime soon. 

+ When exporting a 64-bit application for Windows, a .bat file is created,
  because our .exe doesn't yet support 64-bit. Assuming you have a 64-bit
  JVM installed, the .bat file should load things properly.

+ Because serial only supports 32-bit on OS X, exporting an application 
  that uses serial will only create a application.macosx32 folder, which 
  is a 32-bit app for Mac OS X. No application.macosx64 will be created, 
  nor will a universal application.macosx folder. This is also the case 
  for other libraries that have only 32- or 64-bit support. See earlier
  note that 32- and 64-bit support is an f*ing nightmare.

[ video ] 

+ The most significant change in this release is that the new video library
  from Andres (based on his old gsvideo library) is nearing fully fucntional.

+ MovieMaker is going to be replaced by a Tool that allows you to sequence
  a set of images together into a movie file. The tool currently has a GUI
  bug that breaks it, but this will be fixed sometime soon.

[ other changes ]

+ Application is now the default export (instead of Applet). 

+ Change to how dataPath() and dataFile() work. This is an undocumented
  function, but for those using it, here's the skinny: 

  dataPath() is only available with applications, not applets or Android.
  On Windows and Linux, this is simply the data folder, which is located
  in the same directory as the EXE file and lib folders. On Mac OS X, this
  is a path to the data folder buried inside Contents/Resources/Java.
  For the latter point, that also means that the data folder should not be
  considered writable. Use sketchPath() for now, or inputPath() and
  outputPath() once they're available in the 2.0 release.

  dataPath() is not supported with applets because applets have their data
  folder wrapped into the JAR file. To read data from the data folder that
  works with an applet, you should use other methods such as createInput(),
  createReader(), or loadStrings().

+ Additional library files included with application exports are now placed 
  in the 'lib' folder on Linux and Windows, or buried inside the OS X app.
  This helps prevent the unsightly mess of DLLs that were crowding the
  root folder of exported applications on Windows and Linux.

+ If noLoop() has been called but a sketch is resized, redraw() will be 
  called to update the screen.

PROCESSING 2.0a1 (REV 0200) - 2 September 2011

to learn about what's different: http://wiki.processing.org/w/Changes

[ since we last spoke ]

PROCESSING REV 0198 - 23 June 2011

Major internal work as we start blowing things up for 2.0. The main things are
covered on the changes page in the Wiki: http://wiki.processing.org/w/Changes

This is an interim release so that Andres can do a workshop. Not recommended
for casual use. Hostile or belligerent whiners need not apply.

Android mode has received zero testing, so XML, SVG, 3D, and other major 
features may be broken. See statement directly above.

PROCESSING 1.5 (REV 0196) - 17 April 2011

A lot has changed in the nine months since 1.2.1 was released, the biggest
being the introduction of "modes" for the editor, allowing you to switch
between Android development or the classic desktop/web mode. More modes are
coming in future releases.

Another significant change is a fix for applets that were stuttering or 
appearing to run very, very slowly in Firefox 4 and Chrome. That's the major
reason that we're releasing this version in advance on 2.0 later this summer.

All of the changes since 1.2.1 are listed in this document. If you get stuck,
give it a search to see if there might be a clue about something that has
changed. Or if you have problems, please file a bug.

For people who have been using OPENGL2 in the pre-releases, the library
has been removed from 1.5, and will return in future pre-releases before
eventually replacing the built-in OpenGL library for 2.0.

Meanwhile, here are the changes since revision 0195, the last pre-release:

[ pde ]

PROCESSING REV 0194 - 9 March 2011

Lots of fixes for late-breaking problems in release 0193.

[ fixes ] 

+ The Auto Format command went missing in 0193. It's back for 0194, but is 
  now located in the Edit menu, where it will stay for the rest of its long
  and happy life.

+ The "Import Library" menu wasn't being updated properly in 0193. Note that
  for the time being, there are no core libraries on Android. (OpenGL is built
  in, for instance.)

+ Fix mode switching for Windows and Linux.

+ Library examples weren't showing up in 0193, now they're back.

+ Fix for flicker problem in the default renderer.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=558

+ The examples menu wasn't completely removed in 0193. 

+ Remove "temporarily skipping deletion of" debugging message on export.

+ Properly reload examples & libraries when changing the sketchbook location.

+ Fix a problem with untitled sketches and mode switching.

+ Fix problem with Sketch Permissions for Android.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=559

[ notes ] 

+ Because both OpenGL and OpenGL2 are present, there may be conflicts if you
  implement any OpenGL-specific code outside the Processing API. If your sketch
  includes either of the following lines:

  import javax.media.opengl.*;
  import javax.media.opengl.glu.*;

  then you should remove one of the OpenGL libraries, depending on which you
  would like to use. 

+ OpenGL is built-in on Android. You don't need to add it as a library, the
  way you do with the desktop. A "import processing.opengl.*" line won't
  hurt anything (the preprocessor removes it), but it's also not necessary.
  (This is also noted in the Android wiki.)

+ Library examples no longer show up buried in the sketchbook. Instead they
  can be found in the "Libraries" and "Contributed Libraries" sections of
  the examples window.

[ additions ]

+ Added a new icon for "Export to Application", along the lines of the 
  icons used on the Android side. 

+ Remove warning about the broken build.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=519

PROCESSING REV 0193 - 8 March 2011

The PDE is receiving a major overhaul. The most obvious change is that 
there's now a menu that allows you to switch between "modes". "Standard"
is the Java-based mode that we're all used to, and "Android" compiles 
things for Android devices. 

Basically it's all pre-releases from here until 2.0. 

With the mode support, it will soon be possible to embed other projects, 
like the Python version, or the JS exporter, directly inside the PDE. 
More on this later.

This release also fixes a handful of Android problems, like the use of
libraries, the code folder, and so on.

[ core ] 

+ Fix problem that made applets suck in Google Chrome and Firefox 4.

+ Fix java.lang.OutOfMemoryError using get() and image() inside a tight loop.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=42

+ Changed default font to Lucida Sans, available on all platforms. 
  This means that your text may be a slightly different size if you haven't
  used textFont(), but hey, you probably don't use the default font, right? 
  A fella (or gal) like you?

+ textAlign() incorrect with default font on Mac OS X 10.6
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=362

+ Clean up how PDF fonts are handled. Default to writing fonts as shapes, 
  which makes PDF files larger, but is likely to work in more cases. If you
  want editable/real text, you can call textMode(MODEL) right after creating
  the PDF renderer (directly below size() or beginRecord()).
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=416

+ Saving a PGraphics as jpg using save() makes a cmyk file
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=415

+ Fix bizarre window placement when using Present mode on OS X.

[ pde changes/fixes ] 

+ Added support for separate 32 and 64 bit versions of libraries.

+ Added a 64 bit version of the OpenGL library.

+ Updates to Java 6u23 in the download.

+ Fix issue with javac.exe not being included in the download.

+ Also added opengl2, which rolls GLGraphics and the new Android OpenGL
  library into a newer, faster, more amazinger OpenGL that will eventually
  be the default.

+ Added a *lot* of examples. This has also had the effect of making the 
  download enormous. It's currently obese. We'll sort that out later.

+ Code folder oddity on application export (in SVN)
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=486

+ Processing cannot run because it could not ... store your settings.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=410

+ AutoFormat unecessarily adds spaces to function with multiple args
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=462

+ Fix for linux build script (thanks to Kevin Keraudren)
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=466

+ Fix the encoding on OS X for the "Fix Encoding and Reload" function

+ Hex value from color picker does not start with #
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=529

+ Console, preferences cleanup: removed build.path, as well as
  console.output.file, and console.error.file. Also removed 'console' 
  true/false from preferences.

+ Change console to write to the 'console/' folder in settings.
  This may eventually create a problem with logs that need to be cleaned,
  but we'll keep an eye on it for now.

+ Add splash image on OS X.

+ Added window for examples. It's a bit ugly, but the menu was too much
  and we should be able to clean this feller up later. Also makes the 
  examples a bit more obvious.

+ Updated the serial library for Mac OS X
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=503
  http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Download

+ Accented letter input is broken (on OS X and Windows)
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=335
  Had to disable input method support (Japanese) for now.

+ For projects with too many tabs, condense the ones that are used less.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=54
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=17

[ fixed in 0192 ] 

+ Auto-format screws up if/else/else if blocks
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=325

+ Exported libraries don't mantain symbolic links
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=353

[ android edits ]

+ Add better icons from Casey for exported applications. 

+ Remove the need to download the android core.jar separately
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=421

+ Remove the Google APIs requirement, just use the standard.
  This means losing the standard skin on the emulator, but we'll see
  about bringing it back in some other fashion in the future.
  We weren't actually using the Google APIs, so it seemed silly
  because of how much complexity it added.

+ Deal with issue of debug certificates expiring.
  http://forum.processing.org/topic/ant-rules-r3-xml-209-395-error#25080000000262001

+ Fix use of .java files in Android projects
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=404

+ Save state for whether using Android or Standard mode
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1380
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=202

+ New mode support makes the Android switch less clunky
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1379
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=201

+ With mode support, "Run on Device" and "Run in Emulator" instead of 
  "Run" and "Present".

[ internal changes ] 

+ Removed build.path from preferences.txt.
  Not really used anywhere, just trying to clean things up.

+ Removed 'console.output.file' and 'console.error.file'.
  These weren't respected as paths, no reason for them.

+ Change console to write to the 'console/' folder in settings. 
  This may eventually create a problem with logs that need to be cleaned, 
  but we'll keep an eye on it for now.

+ Removed 'console' true/false from preferences.

+ Cannot reproduce problem with wrong character encoding in the console.

PROCESSING REV 0192 - 18 December 2010

This release contains a roll-up of lots of bug fixes. However, it's being
released before it's ready, so it should only be used by people who are having
trouble with the new Android SDK release (revision 8) from Google, which 
broke Android support last week.

This version of Processing for Android *requires* Android SDK Tools Release 8. 
If you're not using release 8, and don't have the necessary components 
installed, you'll get (confusing) error messages saying that the SDK location 
is not set, and that it could not find an SDK in the location that you specify.

As for this being an early release, the problem is that major changes were
underway regarding how libraries are handled, so it's quite possible that
library support (in both the standard or Android version) or code folder
support is somewhat broken. So with that caveat, no whining, please.

On a happier note, the changes:

[ android fixes ] 

+ Compile android-core with Java 5 as the target so that it works on OS X 10.5.

[ additions from andres ] 

+ A3D should use lower color depth on older devices.

  the math error canceled out with the default camera settings.
  http://forum.processing.org/topic/possible-3d-bug

+ Also finished the implementation of the getImpl() method in PImage, 
  so it initializes the texture of the new image in A3D mode.

PROCESSING REV 0190 - 18 August 2010

This release is primarily for Android users. For the desktop version, there
are some problems with fonts. If you're using text, especially with PDFs,
you may want to wait until the next release.

Android users should read the Wiki (http://wiki.processing.org/w/Android)
which has a lot of new information. 

[ android ] 

+ Added a new menu to cover enabling/disabling Android mode. 

+ Added a Permissions dialog, so that you can set permissions for your 
  applications, e.g. so you can read from the internet or save files.

+ Added support for icons. Put files named icon-32.png, icon-48.png, 
  and icon-72.png in your sketch folder, and they'll be added to your
  project when it's created. Otherwise you'll get an ugly blue dot 
  default icon. You've been warned.

+ Finish implementing the size() command on Android. See the Wiki for notes.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1397
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=211

+ Finish implementation of P3D/OpenGL/A3D for Android.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1396
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1401

+ Allow screenWidth/Height as parameters to size().

+ Fix mouseX/Y mapping when using smaller screen sizes.

+ Fix text ascent/descent problem, text("blah\nblah") wasn't working.

+ Fixed how the manifest file is read/written. 
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1429
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=221

+ Copied the XML and font changes from the desktop version of core.

+ Removing 'import processing.opengl.*' in the preprocessor, since it's
  not needed, and will cause a conflict.

+ Added functions to lock orientation if necessary. Use:
  orientation(LANDSCAPE) and orientation(PORTRAIT) if you need control.

+ createGraphics() works with A3D/P3D/OPENGL for phones that support it.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1488
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=240

+ Fix errors showing up that .java files were duplicates.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=232

[ core ] 

+ Changed skewX/Y to shearX/Y.

+ ENABLE_NATIVE_FONTS was being ignored, native fonts were always used 
  in some cases. However, this broke some other things. But that's why
  this is a pre-release, not a final.

[ xml fixes and changes ] 

+ Changed the XML constructor to take a String for a node name, instead of
  parsing a document from a String. Instead, use XMLElement.parse(String) 
  if you want to read a file.

+ Added getBoolean() methods.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=304

+ Removed namespace versions of the getXxxx() methods. These were never
  documented, and cause more trouble than they're worth.

+ Changing getIntAttribute() et al to getInt(). The old versions are still
  there, but have been deprecated.

+ Added listChildren() method.

+ XML attributes named "xmlns" always returned NULL, now fixed.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1196
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=166

+ When re-saving an .ods file, wasn't including all the namespace at the top.

+ Several fixes to how namespaces are handled (or not handled).

+ Methods to saved XML elements back out again.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=963
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=126

+ Update XMLElement constructor problem.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=342

[ environment ] 

+ Added more specific language to Lnux/Sun/Java error messages on Linux. 
  Also added support for "Oracle" in the name.

+ Fix the New/Open buttons on the toolbar
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=323

+ Changed how "Save As" works, now copies everything in the sketch folder.
  But still ignores applet, application.*, screen-* files/folders

+ Edit > Copy as HTML didn't properly encode < and >
  Also added support for other Unicode entities for non-ASCII characters.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=351

+ Ctrl-Z will undo, but not scroll to where the undo happens. Fixed earlier.

PROCESSING REV 0187 - 12 July 2010

More bug fixes, and one new treat for OS X users. Hopefully we're about 
set to call this one 1.2. Please test and report any issues you find:
http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/list

[ additions ] 

+ On Mac OS X, you're no longer required to have a sketch window open at 
  all times. This will make the application feel more Mac-like--a little
  more elegant and trendy and smug with superiority.

+ Added a warning to the Linux version to tell users that they should be 
  using the official version of Java from Sun if they're not.
  http://wiki.processing.org/w/Supported_Platforms#Linux
  There isn't a perfect way to detect whether Sun Java is in use, 
  so please let us know how it works or if you have a better idea. 

[ fixes ] 

+ "Unexpected token" error when creating classes with recent pre-releases.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=292

+ Prevent horizontal scroll offset from disappearing. 
  Thanks to Christian Thiemann for the fix. 
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=280
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=10

+ Fix NullPointerException when making a new sketch on non-English systems.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=283

+ Fixed a problem when using command-line arguments with exported sketches
  on Windows. Thanks to davbol for the fix.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=303

+ Added requestFocusInWindow() call to replace Apple's broken requestFocus(),
  which should return the previous behavior of sketches getting focus 
  immediately when loaded in a web browser.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=279

+ Add getDocumentBase() version of createInput() for Internet Explorer. 
  Without this, sketches will crash when trying to find files on a web server
  that are not in the exported .jar file. This fix is only for IE. Yay IE!

PROCESSING REV 0186 - 26 June 2010

Minor updates following up on 0185.

[ mixed bag ] 

+ Android SDK requirement is now API 7 (Android 2.1), because Google has
  deprecated API 6 (2.0.1). 

+ More Linux PDF fixes from Matthias Breuer. Thanks!

+ PDF library matrix not reset between frames. (Fixed in 0185.)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1227

+ Updated the URLs opened by the software to reflect the new site layout.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=278

PROCESSING REV 0185 - 20 June 2010

Primarily a bug fix release. The biggest change are a couple tweaks for 
problems caused by Apple's Update 2 for Java on OS X, so this should make
Processing usable on Macs again. 

[ bug fixes ] 

+ Fix for Apple bug that caused an assertion failure when requestFocus() 
  was called in some situations. This was causing the PDE to become unusable
  for opening sketches, and focus highlighting was no longer happening.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=258
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1564
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1569

+ Fixed two bugs with fonts created with specific charsets.

+ Fix from jdf for PImage(java.awt.Image img) and ARGB images
  public PImage(java.awt.Image) was setting the format to RGB (even if ARGB)

+ Large number of beginShape(POINTS) not rendering correctly on first frame
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1572

+ Fix for PDF library and createFont() on Linux, thanks to Matthias Breuer.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1566

+ Fix from takachin for a problem with full-width space with Japanese IME.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1531

+ Reset matrix for the PDF library in-between frames
  also added begin/endDraw between frames
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1227

[ additions ] 

+ Add the changes for "Copy as HTML" to replace the "Copy for Discourse"
  function, now that we've shut down the old YaBB discourse board.
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=271

+ Option to disable re-opening sketches when you start Processing. 
  The default will stay the same, but if you don't like the feature, 
  alter your preferences.txt file to change:
  last.sketch.restore=true
  to the following:
  last.sketch.restore=false
  The issue was originally filed here:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1501
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=245
  However the main problem with this is that due to other errors, the wrong
  sketches are being opened, sketches are sometimes forgotten, or windows
  are opened concurrently on top of one another, creating a bad situation:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=177
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=179
  Those bugs are not yet fixed, but will be addressed in future releases.

+ Option to change the default naming of sketches via preferences.txt. 
  First, you can change the prefix, which defaults to:
  editor.untitled.prefix=sketch_
  And the suffix is handled using dates. The current default (since 1.0) is:
  editor.untitled.suffix=MMMdd
  Or if you want to switch back to the old (six digit) style, you could use:
  editor.untitled.suffix=yyMMdd
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1091

+ Updated bundled JRE/tools to 6u20 for Windows and Linux

+ Several SVG fixes and additions, including some tweaks from PhiLho. These
  changes will be documented in a future release once the API changes are
  complete.

+ Added option to launch a sketch directly w/ linux. Thanks to Larry Kyrala.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1549

+ Pass actual exceptions from InvocationTargetException in registered 
  methods, which improves how exceptions are reported with libraries.

+ Added loading.gif to the js version of the applet loader. Not sure 
  if this is actually working or not, but it's there.

[ android ] 

+ Added permissions for INTERNET and WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE to the default
  AndroidManifest.xml file. This will be addressed in greater detail here:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=275
  And with the implementation of code signing here:
  http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=222

+ Lots of work happening underneath with regards to Android, more updates
  soon as things start evening out a bit.

+ Defaulting to a WVGA screen for the default Processing AVD. 


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 


PROCESSING REV 0184 - 14 April 2010

Pre-release version with more bug fixes. Proper release notes will 
accompany an actual release. If you're curious in the meantime, look
at todo.txt and done.txt from the source tree.

+ The 'Export' option now works in Android, so that you can get at 
  the debug APK that's created.

+ Problems finding javac.exe on Windows should now be fixed. 


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 


PROCESSING REV 0183 - 31 March 2010

Bug fixes for Android, should remove the API v5 requirement and make
things work fine with API v6, the new minimum.


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 


PROCESSING REV 0182 - 29 March 2010 

Bug fix pre-release. This updates three areas:

+ All known bugs with auto-format have been fixed (!)

+ A handful of bug fixes for the Java 5 syntax changes.

+ Fixes for using text with PDF Export.

A more thorough revisions update will be written for the next full
release version (1.2? 1.5? 2.0?) that includes all these changes.


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 


PROCESSING REV 0181 - 19 March 2010

Another update for the preprocessor changes (see below).


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 


PROCESSING REV 0180 - 15 March 2010

This is a interim release with a reworked preprocessor that adds Java 5 
syntax. We're releasing this interim version because we need help testing 
it since it has an impact on any sketch created in the Processing environment.
Basically, we mighta goofed something up big, and we wanna catch it before
we throw it to the wolves. 

The release also fixes a number of preprocessor bugs. Those changes will
be documented a bit later. 


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 


PROCESSING 1.1 (REV 0179) - 11 March 2010

This is the first general-purpose release since 1.0.9. The text below merges 
all of the changes from all the interim revisions, with the exception of the
changes for the upcoming Android tools, which are not enabled in this release.

Lots of bug fixes over 1.0.9, and several changes that improve how fonts are
handled. Because of the large number of changes (and that some functionality
actually changes, if that's actually a word), this is release 1.1 instead
of release 1.0.10. Which is nice, because release 1.0.10 sounds baffling.

[ font changes ]

+ It's no longer necessary to use textFont() before text() and other 
  text-handling functions. The default "SansSerif" font is used, which 
  varies by platform. 

+ Also in this release, the createFont() method will only load characters 
  as they are used, which should greatly improve the font situation on 
  non-Roman systems like Japanese. This will use far less memory, and should
  be all around much more efficient. Formerly, createFont() took several 
  seconds to run, depending on the speed of your system. 
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1111

+ Fixed a problem with the Create Font tool ignoring the 'smooth' setting
  on some systems.

+ Fixed a separate problem with the createFont() method also ignoring the
  'smooth' setting.

+ With the Create Font tool, you can also specify what Unicode character 
  blocks you'd like to use, making a much smaller font.

+ Fonts are no longer power of 2 by default. This should also make them more
  memory efficient. With future OpenGL updates, this will work even better.

[ other changes ] 

+ Lots of edits to the HTML that's used for exported applets. If JavaScript
  is enabled, Sun's new loading functions are used, which offer the best
  compatibility across browsers. If not, the old loading method is used.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1057

+ Changed the OpenGL HTML template to load differently, which should fix a
  NullPointerException in JOGLAppletLanucher with Java 6 Update 18 on Windows,
  and should also be more efficient altogether, because the JOGL libraries can 
  be downloaded just once from Sun, rather than for each sketch that uses them.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1452

+ Code from Takachin that handles full input method support in the editor for
  Japanese and other scripts that are more complicated than Roman text.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=854
  Thanks Takachin! 

+ Now using iText 2.1.7.

+ Changed how imports are handled in sketches. This may break some sketches
  that use java.xxx packages that aren't covered in the Processing reference.

+ With great help from Hansi, moved the build scripts over to Ant.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=151
  Also moved the special JRE for Linux and Windows out of SVN. It'll only be
  downloaded when 'ant dist' is run. 

+ Javadoc is slowly improving. More on that later.

+ Deprecated 'screen', and added screenWidth and screenHeight. Discussion here:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1499

[ bug fixes ] 

+ Fix for filter(DILATE/ERODE) from Dave Bollinger
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1477

+ Added implementation for get/set methods inside PImage (w/o pixels[])

+ Updated JNA to version 3.2.4 to support Windows 7 64-bit
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1424
  Thanks to Maik for tracking down the problem and solution!

+ Fix from taifun_browser to handle texture memory leak with OpenGL and P3D.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1423

+ Hitting ESC inside Color Selector would quit Processing
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1006

+ To fix video, and some other libraries on Snow Leopard, exported applications
  are now explicitly set to run 32-bit on OS X.

+ Fix LITERAL_class so that blah.class syntax can be used in PDE code. 
  Found and fixed by Christian Thiemann. Thank you!
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1466

+ Fix from Chris Lonnen to lock the minimum size for the main processing editor
  frame. (When too small, the console would disappear, etc.) Thanks Chris!
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=25

+ If you overwrite PApplet.main(), you're responsible for what happens.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1446

+ Re-enabled hack for temporary clipping. Clipping still needs to be
  implemented properly, however. Please help!
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1393

+ SVG paths that use 'e' (exponent) not handled properly
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1408

+ Change build scripts to use UTF-8 for encoding with javac
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1394

+ Fix ant.jar/ant-launcher.jar error in the windows/linux build scripts
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1403

+ Fixed a problem where imports inside comments were being included.

[ keys ] 

+ Added ctrl-ins, shift-ins, shift-delete for cut/copy/paste on Windows and 
  Linux, but disabled by default on Mac OS X. You can change the setting by
  altering "editor.keys.alternative_cut_copy_paste" in preferences.txt.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=162

+ Added a preference to change shift-backspace to just mean backspace, 
  rather than delete. Set this entry in preferences.txt:
  editor.keys.shift_backspace_is_delete = true
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1463

+ Added an option for home and end keys traveling to the start/end of the 
  current line rather than the beginning/ending of a sketch. The latter is
  the HIG default for Mac OS X, but drives some people nuts. Change with:
  editor.keys.home_and_end_travel_far = false

PROCESSING REV 0178 - 4 March 2010

Tons of Android work in this release. A2D has been tested and runs correctly
for all of the examples in "Basics" and "Topics". A3D is not quite finished
yet, and the size() command is still causing crashes. 

This release also contains lots of work on Android Mode for the PDE, which
is being worked on by Jonathan Feinberg.

[ core ] 

+ Fix for filter(DILATE/ERODE) from Dave Bollinger
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1477

+ Deprecated 'screen', adding screenW and screenH. See discussion here:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1499

+ Added implementation for get/set methods inside PImage (w/o pixels[])

[ fixes to android core ] 

+ Fix noLoop() and static-mode sketches.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1467

+ Fix the freakout that happens with onPause()

+ App not pausing or closing when switching to another activity
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1404

+ Bezier curves were broken in A2D (extra point is drawn connecting the 
  shape to the corner).

+ Fixed other minor bugs in shape drawing.

+ mask() now implemented in A2D

+ updatePixels() now work properly for A2D

+ set() should now be working

+ Using set() on an image that doesn't have a bitmap, or has pixels loaded.

+ requestImage() now working

+ Drastically improve the performance of the time functions (minute() et al)

+ Point wasn't detecting different stroke weights. 

+ Point wasn't working with strokeWeight > 1.

+ Fix rotate() bug (was using degrees instead of radians)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1497

+ arc() now working properly

+ createGraphics() works, at least with A2D (or aliases P2D and JAVA2D)

+ Fixed "The application ... has stopped unexpectedly." when quitting slow app
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1485

+ test createFont()

+ createGraphics() broken
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1437

+ Remove legacy PGraphics3D class from processing.core.android
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1402

[ android mode ] 

+ Exception handling is much improved.

+ Get stdout and stderr from the emulator/device (println() now works).
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1381

+ Removed the ANDROID_SDK env variable requirement.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1471
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1469


PROCESSING REV 0177 - 21 February 2010

Fix for the Android tools complaining "Open quote is expected for 
attribute "{1}" associated with an element type android:minSdkVersion."

Just posting a new revision because it's easier than writing instructions
for swapping the pde.jar file.


PROCESSING REV 0176 - 20 February 2010

Android changes are at the top, changes for the rest of Processing are listed
below that (a tipoff being that there's no PDF library on Android...)

[ android ]

+ Minimum platform support is changing to 2.0 instead of 1.6. That means 
  "Eclair" or later, and goodbye to my T-Mobile G1, undoubtedly the ugliest
  cell phone I have ever owned. Hello to Droid and Nexus One. 
  Performance is very poor on pre-2.0 devices anyway. 

+ Known issue: Sketches that use noLoop() are currently broken. 
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1467

+ Added support for libraries and the code folder.

+ Classes have moved to the processing.core package instead of 
  processing.android.core.

+ Slashes in the SDK path are now escaped properly on Windows.

+ Fix problems preventing Android Mode from running on Windows
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1432

+ The tint() method now works.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1435

+ loadFont() and text() now work properly. createFont() has not been tested.

[ changes ] 

+ Lots of edits to the HTML that's used for exported applets. If JavaScript
  is enabled, Sun's new loading functions are used, which offer the best
  compatibility across browsers. If not, the old loading method is used.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1057

+ Changed the OpenGL HTML template to load differently, which should fix a
  NullPointerException in JOGLAppletLanucher with Java 6 Update 18 on Windows,
  and should also be more efficient altogether, because the JOGL libraries can 
  be downloaded just once from Sun, rather than for each sketch that uses them.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1452

+ Code from Takachin that handles full input method support in the editor for
  Japanese and other scripts that are more complicated than Roman text.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=854
  Thanks Takachin! 

+ Downgraded the PDF library to use iText 1.5.4, because later versions seem
  to load slower, and don't seem to offer additional benefits. If the PDF 
  library gets worse, please post a bug and we'll go back to the 2.x release
  we were using, or upgrade to the more recent 5.x series.

+ Changed how imports are handled in sketches. This may break some sketches
  that use java.xxx packages that aren't covered in the Processing reference.

+ With great help from Hansi, moved the build scripts over to Ant.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=151
  Also moved the special JRE for Linux and Windows out of SVN. It'll only be
  downloaded when 'ant dist' is run. This makes the build and maintenance 
  more of a mess for me, but will save me from people whining about the 
  large files.

+ Javadoc is slowly improving. More on that later.

[ bug fixes ] 

+ Updated JNA to version 3.2.4 to support Windows 7 64-bit
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1424
  Thanks to Maik for tracking down the problem and solution!

+ Fix from taifun_browser to handle texture memory leak with OpenGL and P3D.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1423

+ Hitting ESC inside Color Selector would quit Processing
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1006

+ To fix video, and some other libraries on Snow Leopard, exported applications
  are now explicitly set to run 32-bit on OS X.

+ Fix LITERAL_class so that blah.class syntax can be used in PDE code. 
  Found and fixed by Christian Thiemann. Thank you!
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1466

+ Fix from Chris Lonnen to lock the minimum size for the main processing editor
  frame. (When too small, the console would disappear, etc.) Thanks Chris!
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=25

+ If you overwrite PApplet.main(), you're responsible for what happens.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1446

[ keys ] 

+ Added ctrl-ins, shift-ins, shift-delete for cut/copy/paste on Windows and 
  Linux, but disabled by default on Mac OS X. You can change the setting by
  altering "editor.keys.alternative_cut_copy_paste" in preferences.txt.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=162

+ Changed shift-backspace to just mean backspace, rather than delete. You
  can change back to the old behavior by setting this entry in preferences.txt:
  editor.keys.shift_backspace_is_delete = true
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1463

+ Added an option for home and end keys traveling to the start/end of the 
  current line rather than the beginning/ending of a sketch. The latter is
  the HIG default for Mac OS X, but drives some people nuts. Change with:
  editor.keys.home_and_end_travel_far = false

[ fonts ]

+ Starting in this release, the createFont() method will only load characters 
  as they are used, which should greatly improve the font situation on 
  non-Roman systems like Japanese. This will use far less memory, and should
  be all around much more efficient. Formerly, createFont() took several 
  seconds to run, depending on the speed of your system. 
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1111

+ Fixed a problem with the Create Font tool ignoring the 'smooth' setting
  on some systems.

+ Fixed a separate problem with the createFont() method also ignoring the
  'smooth' setting.

+ With the Create Font tool, you can also specify what Unicode character 
  blocks you'd like to use, making a much smaller font.

+ Fonts are no longer power of 2 by default. This should also make them more
  memory efficient. With future OpenGL updates, this will work even better.

PROCESSING 1.0.8 (REV 0170) - 18 October 2009

A bonfire of bug fixes. 

[ environment ]

+ Fix bug causing preferences to not save correctly.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1320
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1322
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1325

  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1336
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1337
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1344

+ Remove menu dimming code, in-frame menu bar, and warning message on OS X.
  A year later, Apple fixed the spinning wheel w/ the menu bar problem.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=786

+ Fix "Unrecognized option: -d32" on OS X 10.4
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1324

+ Update the outdated "Get the latest Java Plug-in here" in exported applets.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1331

+ Use temporary files when saving files inside the PDE. Prevents problems
  when the save goes badly (e.g. disk is full).
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=967

+ Fix problem with "Save changes before closing?" was being ignored.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1193

+ Fix problems with adding/deleting tabs.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1332
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1092

+ Saving the project with the same name (but different case) 
  as an existing tab was deleting code on Windows and OS X.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1102

[ core ] 

+ filter(RGB) supposed to be filter(OPAQUE) 
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1346

+ Implement non-power-of-2 textures for OpenGL (on cards where available). 
  This is a partial fix for texture edge problems:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=602

+ Fix get() when used with save() in OpenGL mode

+ Immediately update projection with OpenGL. In the past, projection 
  updates required a new frame. This also prevents camera/project from 
  being reset when the drawing size is changed.

+ Removed an error that caused the cameraNear value to be set to -8. 
  This may cause other problems with drawing/clipping however.

+ Removed methods from PApplet that use doubles. These were only temporarily
  available in SVN, but that's that.

+ Use temporary file with saveStrings(File) and saveBytes(File).

[ updates ]

+ Updated to Minim 2.0.2. (Thanks Damien!)
  http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim

+ Updated Java on Linux and Windows to 6u16.

+ Updated Quaqua to 6.2 on Mac OS X.

PROCESSING 1.0.7 (REV 0169) - 4 September 2009

Bug fixes and updates, also some tweaks for Mac OS X Snow Leopard. 

[ changes ] 

+ Tweaks for Mac OS X Snow Leopard, to force it to run in 32-bit mode.
  This should bring back the video library (if temporarily), and hopefully
  fix serial as well, though I didn't have a serial device handy to test. 

+ Fix problem where line highlighting was off in 'static' mode.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1263

+ Auto-format was killing Unicode characters (how did this last so long?)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1312

+ PVector.angleDistance() returning NaN due to precision errors
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1316

+ Removed a major try/catch block from PApplet.main(), hopefully 
  this will allow some exception stuff to come through properly.

PROCESSING 1.0.4 (REV 0166) - 31 May 2009

Bug fix release. 

[ changes ] 

+ Changed the workaround for Apple's Java bug related to the menus in OS X.
  Rather than placing the menubar inside the sketch window, File > Sketchbook
  and File > Examples are simply dimmed out. Instead, use the Open button
  on the toolbar, which provides access to the same items. The preference
  to place the menu bar inside the window is still available, in case you 
  prefer the previous workaround.

PROCESSING 1.0.1 (REV 0163) - 29 November 2008

Processing 1.0 has arrived! You can read an overview of changes introduced
in the last few months here: http://processing.org/reference/changes.html

Also see the "known issues" section of the troubleshooting page:
http://processing.org/reference/troubleshooting/#known

This release (1.0.1) fixes a handful of issues that only showed up once we 
had more testing, particularly with the wider audience we've received in the
past week following the announcement.

[ bug fixes ] 

+ ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException with File > New
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1067

+ "CallStaticVoidMethod() threw an exception" on some Mac OS X machines
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1063
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1078

+ "editor.indent" preference setting does not work properly
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1073

+ Fixed some "An error occurred while starting the application" problems

+ Added a note about the Minim library to the changes page.

+ Disable parsing of regexps with the split() command
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1060

  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1068

+ Fixed problem where small ellipses weren't showing up.

[ changes ]

PROCESSING 1.0 (REV 0162) - 24 November 2008

Processing 1.0 has arrived! You can read an overview of changes introduced
in the last few months here: http://processing.org/reference/changes.html

[ known issues ] 

+ Sketches that size(w, h, OPENGL) and do not clear the background on each 
  frame can cause major flickering or problems when the screen clears anyway.
  There are several possible solutions:

  1. You may need to disable the default 2x smoothing by using
     hint(DISABLE_OPENGL_2X_SMOOTH).
  
  2. Update the drivers for your graphics card.

  3. Get a decent graphics card -- the OpenGL renderer is for advanced
     use, we don't support using it with cheaper built-in graphics hardware 
     like the Intel GMA 950. 

  4. If you're running Windows Vista, try disabling the Aero theme. 

  This flickering issue is being tracked here:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1056

+ "An error occurred while starting the application" when launching
  Processing.exe on Windows. This is a high priority however we cannot
  reproduce it on any of our test machines, which has delayed a fix.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=986

+ With P2D, P3D, and OPENGL, series of connected lines (such as the stroke 
  around a polygon, triangle, or ellipse) produce unattractive results when 
  strokeWeight is set.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=955

+ Unlike most applications, the menu bar is inside the editor window when
  Processing is used with Mac OS X 10.5. This is a workaround for an Apple 
  bug in Java 1.5 and 1.6 on Mac OS X 10.5 that causes the menu bar to be 
  so excessively slow that the application appears to have crashed.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=786

  Please file a bug report with Apple at bugreporter.apple.com if you want
  this fixed. The problem has existed since the spring, and we first filed 
  a bug  with them in June, and we have received no indication that it when 
  it will be fixed, or if it will ever be fixed.

  Or if you want to take your chances with the slow menu bar, 
  you can change the default setting in the Preferences window.

+ Sketches that use the video library plus OpenGL have a problem on some
  OS X machines. The workaround is listed in Comment #16 of this bug:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=882#c16

+ Command line support arrived in a recent release, but is not working yet.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1048

+ OpenGL rendering is more dim/darker in release 0149 and later.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=958
  Any help tracking this down would be most appreciated.

+ The first few frames of OpenGL sketches on Windows run slowly.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=874

+ When used with P3D, strokeWeight does not interpolate the Z-coordinates 
  of the lines, which means that when rotated, these flat lines may 
  disappear. (Since, uh, lines are, you know, flat.) The OPENGL renderer 
  setting does not share this problem because it always draws lines 
  perpendicular to the screen (which we hope to do in a future release).
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=956

in spite of their historical feel good campiness, i've removed the
notes from earlier releases because this file was getting out of hand.
